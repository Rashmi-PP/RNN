---------------Sentiment analysis using RNN-------------------

This project was done as part of data science course conducted on Udemy by Frank Kane of Sundog education.
The purpose of the project is to make a recurrent neural network for sentiment analysis, ie., classify whether a user liked a movie or not. The data is sourced from IMDb as mentioned in link https://keras.io/api/datasets/imdb/. The training data consist of 5000 reviews and testing set has 20,000 reviews.

The RNN uses LSTM and embedding layers with 20% recurrent dropout rate after each epoch, for 15 epochs. Accuracy of the model is abut 80%.
